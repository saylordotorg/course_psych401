**Unit 3: Classification Systems and Research Methods in Abnormal
Psychology** <span id="3"></span> 
*What are the major categories of psychological disorders and the
defining characteristics of these diagnostic labels? This unit will
provide us with information to address this question and others like
it. First, we will learn about the historical context out of which the
current classification system was developed. Next, we will learn the
terms and concepts you need to fully understand the current
classification system—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4<sup>th</sup> edition (DSM-IV) and the soon to be published
5<sup>th</sup> edition, DSM-5. Finally, we will learn about research
methods used in the service of providing information about disorders to
clinicians, family members, patients, and the general public.   *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 5.75 hours.
