**Unit 4: Anxiety Disorders** <span id="4"></span> 
*The first three units have provided an introduction to the field of
abnormal psychology, highlighting the history, theoretical paradigms,
and methodological considerations that shape the field. In the remaining
units, we will use that framework to learn about some common disorders,
their specifications, and their treatments. We will start by learning
more about anxiety disorders. First, we will take a closer look at
anxiety itself and learn of its potential adaptive nature and
evolutionary function. Next, we will focus on anxiety gone awry, when
anxiety reactions take more extreme forms and cause distress,
disruption, and dysfunction. In this section of the unit, we will learn
how to differentiate between the major subtypes of anxiety disorders
including the different types of phobias, obsessive-compulsive,
generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders. We will learn
more about the potential causes which lead to the development of anxiety
disorders, as seen through the vantage point of a variety of paradigms
in the field of abnormal psychology. We will also learn more about the
research which helps us to understand these disorders more fully and to
treat people with these disorders in more effective ways. Through
hearing various case examples, we will come to appreciate how clinicians
treat this disorder and the prognosis or probability of recovery from
these disorders.  *

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 19.5 hours.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   describe the anxiety reaction, and explain its evolutionary purpose;
-   differentiate between the various subtypes of anxiety disorders
    (i.e., differential diagnosis, prognosis, and driving causes); 
-   identify and describe the important paradigms which seek to explain
    the causes of anxiety disorders;
-   describe the goals, interventions, and processes associated with
    treating these disorders; and
-   explain the various research findings associated with anxiety
    disorders and why they are important.
