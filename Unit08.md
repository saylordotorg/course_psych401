**Unit 8: Schizophrenia** <span id="8"></span> 
*Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and debilitating mental disease. It
can lead to sustained hallucinations and delusions, among other
symptoms, ultimately causing an individual to lose touch with reality.
Although the stigma and ignorance surrounding schizophrenia has lessened
over the years, many misconceptions still exist. In this unit, we will
learn about how schizophrenia has been treated and conceptualized
throughout history. We will also study hard facts about the prevalence,
diagnostic and prognostic picture, and treatment of various forms of
schizophrenia. Lastly, we will examine the most up-to-date research on
schizophrenia and the advancements being made in psychotropic and
psychosocial treatment of this disorder.  *
