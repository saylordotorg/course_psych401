**Unit 9: Dissociative Disorders** <span id="9"></span> 
*The name dissociative disorders is fitting for this group of diagnoses,
which is characterized by a dissociation from a person’s identity. One
of the most dramatic examples of the manifestation of this disconnect
occurs in the case of individuals with dissociative identity disorder,
previously known as multiple personality disorder. With this disorder, a
person can assume as many as 25 distinct personalities which may vary
across multiple dimensions, including gender, reported occupation,
accent, level of extraversion, aggression, and so forth. Although
research has not revealed any one theory which fully explains the nature
of the disorder, it is likely that these dissociations serve a
protective function for the individual with the disorder. In this unit,
we will first define dissociative disorders and identify the common
characteristics among these disorders. Next, we will learn more about
the specific subtypes of the disorder—their prevalence, gender
differences in diagnosis, correlates of the disorder, and theories
surrounding the etiology of the disorder.  *
