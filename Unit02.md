**Unit 2: Influential Paradigms in Abnormal Psychology** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Since the dawn of time, the origins of abnormal behavior have been
shrouded in mystery. The debate as to whether abnormal behavior is
caused by genetic and/or biological mechanisms versus environmental ones
has greatly shaped the field and our understanding of psychopathology.
This nature versus nurture debate is captured through the major defining
paradigms of the field, which seek to explain the causes of abnormal
psychology. In this unit, we will learn about the concepts and
assumptions of the major paradigms that have had the strongest
influences on the field of abnormal psychology. We will also learn about
a new, more inclusive explanation of abnormal behavior that emerged as
the debate subsided—that of the diathesis-stress model. This model
stresses both the genetic and environmental contributions to the
development of psychological disorders.   *
