Abnormal psychology is one of the most recognizable and intriguing
subfields of study in psychology. Part of what makes this field so
intriguing is that it challenges us to define what is normal and
abnormal. Most experts in the field have settled on several criteria to
define abnormal behavior; however, this definition and even the very
existence of certain disorders still remain a source of debate. This
course will help us to define abnormal and normal behaviors and to group
these abnormal phenomena into disorders. These disorders are used to
capture a particular type of abnormal psychological phenomena and to
help us diagnose or make an educated decision regarding what disorder a
patient/client may have. In order to distinguish between different
disorders, clinicians often use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, which identifies the specific criteria used when
diagnosing patients/clients. This manual represents the industry
standard for psychologists and psychiatrists, who often work together to
diagnose and treat psychological disorders. The current version of this
manual is the text revision of the 4<sup>th</sup> edition (DSM-IV-TR),
but a 5<sup>th</sup> edition is planned for release in May of 2013.
Another intriguing component of the field of abnormal psychology is the
question of what causes the development of particular disorders. In hard
sciences, researchers can easily manipulate conditions and isolate
variables. The results from these studies are often fairly convincing
and provide scientists and laypersons alike with a relatively
unambiguous explanation for the questions posed within each respective
field. However, in abnormal psychology, the unit of analysis is human
behavior, which is complex and often prohibits our ability to manipulate
variables of interest in empirical studies. This means that the
conclusions we draw are often up for debate, and hard and fast answers
are often hard to come by. With that said, our current understanding of
the factors which contribute to the development and maintenance of
symptoms associated with these disorders is far more advanced than it
was even 20 years ago. The first section of this course will begin by
defining normal versus abnormal behavior and reviewing the historical
context in which abnormal psychology emerged. It is important to note
that historical context will be woven throughout the course, as it helps
to anchor our current understanding of the field and the disorders it
characterizes. We will then discuss the major theories or paradigms
associated with abnormal psychology, the classification system used to
differentiate and define disorders, and the research methods often used
in the study of abnormal psychology. After we have learned the basic
terminology and parameters which define abnormal psychology, we will
move on to the second section of this course, which addresses individual
disorders, their treatments, and common explanations concerning their
origins. This section represents the majority of the content of this
course and will cover anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, eating
and sleeping disorders, mood disorders, schizophrenia, dissociative
disorders, and personality disorders. This course will cover the basic
concepts surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of abnormal
psychological phenomena. While you may have a basic understanding of the
disorders addressed, we will cover each disorder in great detail. At the
close of this course, you will have a much clearer picture of the
characteristics of individual disorders, the epidemiology and prevalence
of these disorders, the controversy surrounding these disorders, and the
popular groups of both medication and psychosocial interventions used to
treat these disorders.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   describe the historical context from which the current
    conceptualization of abnormal psychology has evolved;
-   identify and describe the main theoretical perspectives/paradigms
    which have influenced the field of abnormal psychology;
-   identify and differentiate the classification of psychological
    disorders;
-   evaluate treatment approaches; and
-   explain the major research findings for each group of disorders and
    how they add to our knowledge of the causes and treatment
    of psychological disorders.

### Course Information

Welcome to PSYCH401: Abnormal Behavior. General information about this
course and its requirements can be found below.    
  
 **Course Designer**: Helena (Mimi) Martin  
  
 **Primary Resources**: This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the following
materials:

-   iTunes: Portland Community College: Dana C. Leighton’s *[Abnormal
    Psychology](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/abnormal-psychology-lectures/id265029591) *Lecture
    Series
-   University of Central Oklahoma: Dr. Caleb W. Lack’s [*Abnormal
    Psychology: An E-text*](http://abnormalpsych.wikispaces.com/)
-   [*Introduction to
    Psychology*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Introduction%20to%20Psychology.pdf),
    v. 1.0.1
-   University of Tasmania: Dr. Saxby Pridmore’s *Download of
    Psychiatry*

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Units 1–3, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units. You will also need to complete:

-   Subunit 4.3.2 Assessment
-   Unit 7 Assessment
-   Unit 8 Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the course materials, including the assessments
listed above.   
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **95.5
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories, to determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit, and then set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you 4 hours to complete, and Unit 2 should
take approximately 8.25 hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete Unit 1 (a total of 4 hours) on
Monday night; the introduction to Unit 2 (a total of 2.5 hours) on
Tuesday night; subunit 2.1 (a total of 3.75 hours) on Wednesday night;
and so forth.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions**: As clinical psychology and psychotherapy address
abnormal behavior, there are several units within the clinical
psychology and psychotherapy courses which overlap with the content of
this course. If you have already taken these courses, it may be helpful
to review some of the applicable material, particularly if you think you
would benefit from additional clarity on a topic addressed in this
course. If you have not taken these courses, please note that although
there is crossover in the content addressed, each course is developed to
reflect different vantage points within the field of psychology. This
particular course aims to give you an understanding of the basis of
human behavior, what defines behavior gone awry, what happens when
behavior is defined as abnormal, and the multiple perspectives on the
causes and treatment of various disorders.
