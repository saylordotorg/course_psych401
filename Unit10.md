**Unit 10: Personality Disorders** <span id="10"></span> 
*The disorders we have learned about thus far are treatable through both
psychotropic medication and psychosocial interventions. These disorders
have a distinct course and often involve precipitants that cause
symptoms to intensify. They are characterized as “Axis I Disorders,” or
major mental disorders known as clinical disorders. In this unit, we
will switch gears and discuss a different set of psychological
disorders—that of personality disorders—which fall into the “Axis II
Disorders” category in the* *DSM-IV-TR. Although there is some
controversy surrounding the distinctions between these disorders and the
existence of these disorders, most clinicians agree that there are
groups of people who come to treatment with similar profiles or
traits. Whether or not these clients present with odd or eccentric
behavior; dramatic, emotional, or erratic behavior; or anxious or
fearful behavior, they all seem to share a difficulty with creating and
maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships. In this unit, we will
first learn how to define personality and what is* *normal* *versus*
*abnormalin the realm of traits. Next, we will learn about the
problematic and controversial aspects of diagnosing individuals with
personality disorders. We will also learn about the different ways of
being and behaving that characterize a variety of personality
disorders. Finally, we will turn our attention to the research on
personality disorders and the treatment recommendations and prognosis of
such disorders.  *
