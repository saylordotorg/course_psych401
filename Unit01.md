**Unit 1: Introduction to Abnormal Psychology** <span id="1"></span> 
*What is abnormal behavior? Why does it exist? How have our conceptions
of abnormal behavior changed and progressed over the years? This unit
will address these basic questions about the field of abnormal
psychology. We will first seek to define the line between abnormal and
normal behavior. Next, we will take a look at the historical context
that has influenced the major paradigms/theories of abnormal psychology.
Lastly, we will address two paradigms which have influenced, albeit in a
more peripheral way, the field of abnormal psychology: the
phenomenological paradigm and the statistical, or trait, paradigm. At
the close of this unit, you will have a framework for defining and
understanding the concepts behind this fascinating subfield of
psychology.  *
