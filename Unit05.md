**Unit 5: Somatoform Disorders** <span id="5"></span> 
*From Plato to Aristotle to Descartes, philosophers have long debated
the nature of the mind-body connection. This question has intrigued many
for centuries and continues to be a topic of debate and discussion in
the field of psychology. Somatoform disorders exemplify a situation in
which psychological distress manifests itself in physical ways and
highlights the mind-body connection. In this unit, we will explore the
nature of somatization and learn about how the major paradigms in
abnormal psychology explain the origins of these disorders. We will also
learn more about the controversy over whether or not society’s tendency
to medicalize psychological or physical distress contributes to the
prevalence of this disorder. Lastly, we will learn more about the
specific types of somatoform disorders, the diagnostic criteria which
define them, and the treatments which seek to cure them.*
