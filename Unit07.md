**Unit 7: Mood Disorders** <span id="7"></span> 
*Depression has been described as the common cold of psychological
disorders. Although this metaphor accurately captures the fact that
depression is the most cited reason for clinical treatment, it downplays
the very real and far-reaching detrimental impact that depression has on
those diagnosed, family and friends of those diagnosed, and society as a
whole. Mood disorders are one of the leading causes of suicide in the
United States—a phenomena which has a large negative impact on society
and its members. In this unit, we will study the major types of mood
disorders including depression, bipolar disorder, dysthymia, and
cyclothymia. We will learn which characteristics are common to all mood
disorders and then more about the specific symptoms and treatments
associated with each type of mood disorder. Finally, we will learn about
the phenomenon of suicide. In this section, we will learn more about the
factors associated with an increased risk of suicide and what research
findings say about predicting and preventing suicide. Finally, we will
be provided with recommendations for how to help a friend, colleague, or
family member when he/she has expressed suicidal thoughts, feelings, or
behaviors.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit will take you approximately 15.25 hours.
