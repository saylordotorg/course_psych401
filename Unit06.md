**Unit 6: Eating and Sleeping Disorders** <span id="6"></span> 
*Like somatoform disorders, eating and sleeping disorders can often be
conceptualized as manifestations of psychological issues in physical
forms. Unlike somatoform disorders, eating and sleeping disorders are
relatively common psychological disorders which impact millions of
people every year. In this unit, we will first turn our attention to
eating disorders which have potentially grave physical
consequences. These disorders particularly impact women, a fact which
sheds light on the sociocultural contributors to this disorder. In this
first part of unit, we will learn more about the potential
sociocultural, genetic, and familial contributors to the development of
eating disorders. We will also learn about the major types of eating
disorders and how clinicians treat these disorders. We will then turn
our attention towards sleeping disorders. We will first discuss normal
sleep patterns. Next, we will studythe nature of disrupted sleep and the
assessments and treatments associated with various types of sleep
disorders.  *

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 7.5 hours to complete.
